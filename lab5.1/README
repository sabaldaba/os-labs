<p> Memory

On all computer systems memory is a scarce resource. No matter how much memory is available,
it never seems to be enough.
Linux applications, except for a few specialized embedded applications, are
never permitted to access physical memory directly. It might appear so to the application, but
what the application is seeing is a carefully controlled illusion.
Linux provides applications with a clean view of a huge directly addressable memory space.
Additionally, it provides protection so that different applications are protected from each other.
You allocate memory using the malloc call in the standard C library. The malloc function is guaranteed to return memory that is aligned so that it can be cast to a pointer of any type.
